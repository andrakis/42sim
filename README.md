======

A simulator designed by simulators, to simulate life, the world, the universe, and everything in between.

Goals:
------
* Procedurally generated planet (from the erosion and creation of the landscape, to the life and evolution that takes place)
* In a galaxy, each solar entity affects the others in small but significant ways (gravity, tides, etc)
* Life evolves with / without player interaction, eventually leading to space travel
* Each step in a planets evolution further abstracts player descision (ie, less micro-managing as life evolves)
* Visit other planets and affect their evolution by your mere presence / act
* Small size: Every planet should be able to be procedurally generated, and include any variables neighbouring planets / life forms introduce, so that finding the state of a planet between X and Y year is a calculation (ie, don't store massive data files)
